#   This option is better for people who do not
#   want to set up postgres, which is time consuming
#   and not necessary for most development work
# development:
#   adapter: sqlite3
#   database: db/development.sqlite3
#   pool: 5
#   timeout: 5000

# for postgres comment lines below in
# It is preferable to use postgres because this
# is what's used in production and it is necessary
# to work on the coldmap.
# development:
#   adapter: postgresql
#   database: twinedb
#   username: root
#   password: password
#   host: localhost
#   port: 5432
#   pool: 5
#   timeout: 5000

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
# memory database enables much faster tests
# test:
#   adapter: sqlite3
#   database: ":memory:"
#   pool: 5
#   timeout: 5000
